										<p> You wake up once again, but this time in your own bed. It is dark in your room. You start looking for the light switch. After finding it and fumbling for a while the light turns on. The light is bright and it fills the room. <br> There is no one else in the room. You are alone. You are safe. <br> Once you have rested for a while you decide to get out of bed. You put some clothes on and walk up to your bedroom door. You can hear voices on the other side, but can't quite make out what they are. What do you do? <br> Leave or stay? </p>

You take the lantern from your bag and light it. The light doesn't reach very far, but atleast you can see where you are stepping. You walk on until you start hearing distinct voices.
